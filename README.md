Integration setup complete. Your Gaggiuino is now available as a device.

### Note: Currently, no API Endpoint allows getting the currently selected profile. That's why the initial profile selection is empty. However, the selector selects the profile correctly.

### Note: While the Gagguino Profile IDs are unique, their names are not, you can have multiple profiles with the same name, but their IDs will be different. The profile selection method calls for a profile ID to be provided, that's why I decided to visually represent the selector items as both Profile Names and their corresponding IDs. I know this is not very convenient in automation, but I am open to your ideas.
